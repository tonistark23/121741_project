		<img src="images/3.jpg" alt="" />
		<p> Aling Nena's business has been alive, kicking, and innovative as far back as 2013. After
		having an Inventory System made for herself, she later decided to go on the web as she was
		inspired by her daughter, who left to go to Canada for some guy with the initials OT. </p>

		<p> Today her sari sari store is one of the most high-class and high technology stores in 
		the Philippines. It still never fails to sell the products at standard price, though,
		giving Filipinos the basic products they need everywhere. </p>
